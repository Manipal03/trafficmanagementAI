Smart Traffic Management using Artificial Intelligence and the Raw data of the Traffic 

Smart Traffic Management System using AI
Overview
This project aims to develop a Smart AI-Based Traffic Management System that dynamically adjusts traffic light timings based on real-time traffic data. The system utilizes AI and machine learning algorithms to predict traffic flow and optimize the traffic signals, reducing congestion and improving traffic efficiency in urban areas.

Features
Real-Time Traffic Monitoring: Collect data from sensors, cameras, and IoT devices to monitor traffic conditions.
AI-Based Traffic Prediction: Utilize machine learning models to predict traffic patterns and adjust traffic lights accordingly.
Adaptive Traffic Light Control: Dynamically adjust traffic light timings to optimize traffic flow.
Feedback Loop: Continuously collect and analyze traffic data to further refine the AI model and improve the system's performance.
System Architecture
Data Collection: Sensors, cameras, and IoT devices gather traffic data.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and process the collected data to make it suitable for analysis.
Real-Time Traffic Analysis: Analyze the processed data to detect traffic patterns and congestion levels.
AI-Based Traffic Prediction: Use AI algorithms to predict traffic flow and identify the best strategies for traffic light control.
Traffic Light Adjustment: Adjust traffic lights in real-time based on the optimized timings from the AI model.
Feedback Loop: Continuously monitor and improve the system by feeding back real-time data into the model.
Technologies Used
Programming Languages: Python, MATLAB
AI/ML Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Scikit-learn
Hardware: Sensors, Cameras, Microcontrollers (optional for physical deployment)
Simulation Tools: SUMO, MATLAB, or custom Python scripts
